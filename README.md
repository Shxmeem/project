Roger that. Here’s a **clean, straightforward, undergraduate-level version**, trimmed down, simplified, and written in a crisp, corporate-style tone while keeping the substance solid.

# **1.1 Introduction**

India’s payment ecosystem has shifted dramatically in the last decade. The launch of UPI in 2016 changed how citizens pay for everyday needs—groceries, bills, travel, micro-payments, and e-commerce. With instant transfers, zero fees, and widespread merchant acceptance, UPI has become the dominant retail payment channel in India. Cards continue to play a strong role – particularly for high-value purchases and online shopping – while cash remains relevant for small retail spends, rural markets, and traditional consumers.

Government initiatives like Digital India, rising smartphone adoption, better internet access, and post-COVID behavioral changes have accelerated the move toward digital payments. Still, preferences vary across income groups, age groups, and regions. Some people value convenience, some trust cards more, and others stick with cash because it feels familiar and easy.

This study examines what drives these choices and why different groups prefer UPI, cards, or cash in their daily transactions.

# **1.2 Statement of the Problem**

Despite UPI’s explosive growth, cash usage is still high across several segments. Cards also hold a strong consumer base. The challenge is understanding why people choose one mode over another when all options are available.

Key issues:

* What factors (convenience, security, habit, cost, trust) influence payment choice?
* Why is UPI preferred in cities but cash still dominant in parts of rural India?
* How do demographics (age, income, education) shape payment behavior?
* Why do cards continue to lead for high-value and online purchases?

This study aims to identify and analyze these gaps.

# **1.3 Objectives of the Study**

1. To identify the key factors influencing people’s preference for UPI, card, or cash.
2. To understand how demographic groups differ in their payment choices.
3. To analyze how payment mode is influenced by convenience, security, cost, trust, and availability.
4. To study real-world patterns of usage for daily transactions.
5. To provide insights for banks, businesses, and policymakers to improve payment adoption.

# **1.4 Scope of the Study**

* **Area:** India (urban and rural).
* **Population:** General citizens of all age groups who make daily transactions.
* **Time period:** From UPI’s introduction in 2016 to the present.
* **Payment methods covered:** UPI, debit/credit cards, and cash.
* **Focus:** Everyday payments such as groceries, retail shopping, transport, utilities, and online purchases.

The study uses both primary information (surveys/interviews) and secondary data from RBI, NPCI, and industry reports.

# **1.5 Research Methodology**

* **Research Design:** Descriptive study.
* **Data Sources:**

  * *Primary data:* questionnaires, online surveys, or small interviews.
  * *Secondary data:* RBI reports, NPCI transaction statistics, published articles, and consumer surveys.
* **Sampling:** Simple random or stratified sampling depending on availability of respondents.

# **1.6 Limitations of the Study**

* The sample size may not fully represent India’s large population.
* Responses may be biased due to personal opinions or database errors.
* Payment behavior changes quickly as new features and technologies launch.
* Rural and low-internet areas may be harder to reach for data collection.
