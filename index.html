            <h2>1.1 Introduction</h2>
            <p>India's payment system has undergone a major transformation over the last decade, shifting from a cash-centric model to a digitally driven one. The launch of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in 2016 marked a turning point. UPI enabled instant money transfers, QR-based merchant payments, and seamless integration with smartphones, making digital payments accessible even to first-time users. As a result, UPI has become a preferred mode for day-to-day transactions such as groceries, food orders, travel payments, and peer-to-peer transfers.</p>
            
            <p>Card payments (credit and debit cards) continue to remain relevant, especially for high-value purchases, e-commerce transactions, and retail outlets with card-swipe machines. Cash, despite the growth of digital alternatives, still plays a significant role in India due to habits, accessibility issues, and its universal acceptance. Similar patterns can also be observed among consumers in Malappuram Municipality.</p>
            
            <p>Government programs like Digital India, financial inclusion through Jan Dhan accounts, smartphone penetration, and COVID-19-driven behavior shifts have accelerated digital adoption. However, consumer choices remain diverse. While UPI is dominant among urban youth, cash continues to be preferred among older and less digitally aware users. These differences are also reflected in the payment behavior of residents of Malappuram Municipality.</p>
            
            <p>This study investigates the factors that influence people's preference for UPI, card, or cash in daily transactions, with special reference to Malappuram Municipality.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>1.2 Statement of the Problem</h2>
            <p>Despite the availability of secure and convenient digital payment systems like UPI, many people continue to prefer cash due to habits, lack of awareness, fear of technology, and perceived complexity. Cash transactions also involve practical risks such as counterfeit or damaged currency. Card payments are commonly used for higher-value and business transactions, especially where trust and international usage are important.</p>
            
            <p>In Malappuram Municipality, users exhibit mixed preferences for UPI, card, and cash based on factors such as age, education, accessibility, and trust. This study seeks to understand the factors influencing people's preference for UPI, card, or cash in daily transactions, with special reference to Malappuram Municipality.</p>
            
            <h2>1.3 Objectives of the Study</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To identify the key factors influencing people's preference for UPI, cash, and card payments in Malappuram Municipality.</li>
                <li>To compare the choice of payment methods between rural and urban respondents in the study area.</li>
                <li>To analyze the level of technological awareness among users based on age, gender, and occupation.</li>
                <li>To study the pattern of usage of different payment methods in daily transactions.</li>
