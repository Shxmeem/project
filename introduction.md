# 1.1 Introduction

India’s payment system has undergone a major transformation over the last decade, shifting from a cash-centric model to a digitally driven one. The launch of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in 2016 marked a turning point. UPI enabled instant money transfers, QR-based merchant payments, and seamless integration with smartphones for making digital payments accessible even to first-time users. As a result, UPI has become the preferred mode for day-to-day transactions such as groceries, food orders, travel payments, and peer-to-peer transfers.

Card payments (credit and debit cards) continue to remain relevant, especially for high-value purchases, e-commerce transactions, and retail outlets with card-swipe machines. Cash, despite the growth of digital alternatives, still plays a significant role in India due to habits, accessibility issues in rural regions, and its universal acceptance.

Government programs like Digital India, financial inclusion through Jan Dhan accounts, smartphone penetration, and COVID-19-driven behavior shifts have accelerated digital adoption. However, consumer choices remain diverse. While UPI is dominant among urban youth, cash continues to be preferred among older and rural demographics. Cards retain strong usage in organized retail and online marketplaces.

This study investigates the factors that influence people’s preference for UPI, card, or cash in daily transactions across India.

# 1.2 Statement of the problem

Despite the availability of secure and convenient digital payment systems like UPI, many people continue to prefer cash due to habits, lack of awareness, fear of technology, and perceived complexity. Cash transactions also involve practical risks such as counterfeit or damaged currency. Card payments are commonly used for higher-value and business transactions, especially where trust and international usage are important. This study seeks to understand the factors influencing people’s preference for UPI, card, or cash in daily transactions.
